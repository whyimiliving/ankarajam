In order to use the trees along with URP you have to install the "Oak Trees Version 2.0 URP.unitypackage".
The "Oak Trees Version 2.0 URP.unitypackage" contains tweaked shaders, prefabs, materials and demos for Unity 2019.4 and URP 7.3.1. / 7.5.1..

In case you use a higher version of URP you may have to install one of the provided "CTI_URP_XXXX_runtime" packages afterwards.
CTI_URP_14plus_runtime for URP 14+ will switch the shaders from HLSL to Shader Graph.
Using URP 14+ needs you to also install the "Oak Trees Version 2.0 URP 14plus" package.

In case you come across any issue, please let me know.
